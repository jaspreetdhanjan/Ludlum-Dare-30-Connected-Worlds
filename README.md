# Ludum Dare 30 - Connected Worlds

<h2>Introduction</h2>

This was a submission to LD30 I recently found lying around on my HDD. I made this when I was very, very bad at making games, writing code and drawing sprites â€“ I still kind of am. The game is about trying to pass each world by flying through portals and killing these robotic dinosaurs with explosives. It is still very broken.
